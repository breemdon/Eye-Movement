# Eye-Movement

## Description
Eye Movement Assignment for MIT xPro Course: Professional Certification in Coding

In the starter code of this assignment I built upon an exisiting eye and added to the existing code to animate the movement of the eye as it followed the mouse movement. The goal of this assignment was to add a second eye that followed the mouse movement so both eyes were moving together. This involved 

## How to Run
This eye movement activity is simple because it is controlled by mouse movement. Move your mouse and the eyes will follow!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
This project can continue to be improved upon by adding features and animation to the eyes. For example I could add eye lashes that may blink. I would make the eyes go different directions with mouse movement. The code used in this project inspire all different kinds of movement.
